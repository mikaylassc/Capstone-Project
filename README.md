# Capstone Project – Pet Care Assistant

## Project Description
This program helps pet owners determine basic care recommendations for their dog based on age and activity level. It uses user input, variables, and conditional statements to provide simple feedback.
In Milestone 2, the program was expanded to include functions and a loop, improving organization and allowing repeated user interaction without restarting the program.

## Features
- Accepts user input for dog age and activity level
- Uses conditional logic to determine care advice
- Defines and calls multiple functions with parameters and return values
- Implements a while loop for repeated interaction
- Demonstrates foundational Python concepts including variables, conditionals, functions, and loops

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Variables and data types  
- User input and type casting  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Function definition and function calls  
- Parameters and return values  
- Loop control using `while` and `break`  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.14.2
